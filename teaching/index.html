	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<h2>I am interested in teaching in-person and online programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I can also develop a course on topics related to cryptocurrency and blockchain at either the undergraduate or the graduate levels to help students keep up with the rapid changes and challenges that FinTech innovations may bring to the accounting profession. Although I am mainly interested in teaching financial accounting related courses, I am open to teach in other areas such as data analytics.</h2>
