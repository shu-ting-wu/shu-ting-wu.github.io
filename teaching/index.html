	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<h2>Teaching Interests</strong></h2>
	<p>I am interested in teaching in-person and online programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
	<p>I can also develop a course on topics related to cryptocurrency and blockchain to help students keep up with the rapid changes and challenges that FinTech innovations may bring to the accounting profession.</p>
	<p>Although I am mainly interested in teaching financial accounting related courses, I am open to teach in other areas such as data analytics.</p>
	<h2>Teaching Experience</strong></h2>

		<h3>Instructor, Principles of Financial Accounting (online)</h3>
		<p>- Broad College of Business, Michigan State University<br>
			Summer 2021</p>
		<p>- Selected student evaluations</p>
		<p><em>“Professor Wu was an outstanding instructor. She was enthusiastic, even though the class was entirely online. She was well prepared and offered a plethora of extra course materials to help the students better understand the content. She answered any and all questions extremely thoroughly and was more than helpful at all times. I could not have asked for a better instructor.”</em></p>
		<p><em>“Shuting Wu did an excellent job teaching this course over the past weeks. She demonstrated that she understood what she was teaching and went at a very understandable pace. The course layout is very clear, as well as what is expected of the students. If she teaches this course in the future, I would recommend her to any student.”</em></p>
		<p><em>“Shuting was very thorough in her lectures and going over the course material. She always answered students' questions in-depth, ensuring their concerns were resolved. I also believe the examinations were extremely fair as each contained covered course material; Shuting gave us Practice Exams to give us an idea of what to expect.”<em></p>
