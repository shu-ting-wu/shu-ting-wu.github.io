	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<h2>Teaching Interests</strong></h2>
	<p>I am interested in teaching in-person and online programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
	<p>I can also develop a course on topics related to cryptocurrency and blockchain to help students keep up with the rapid changes and challenges that FinTech innovations may bring to the accounting profession.</p>
	<p>Although I am mainly interested in teaching financial accounting related courses, I am open to teach in other areas such as data analytics.</p>
