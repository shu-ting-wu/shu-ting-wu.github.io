	    Abstract: Building on theories in psychology and human memory research, this study examines whether memory retrieval affects the biases in management earnings forecasts. Specifically, we focus on the changes in the bias in management earnings forecasts when the 2008 financial crisis triggered managers’ memory retrieval related to economic recessions. Using a sample of annual earnings forecasts issued for fiscal years ending between 2002-2018, we find that CEOs who accumulate more memories of past recessions and those who observe higher unemployment at their headquarter locations during the financial crisis embedded more pessimism in their earnings forecasts. Further analyses show that the increased pessimism can take up to five years to return to the pre-crisis level, suggesting that learning may play a role in changes in forecast bias. This paper enhances our understanding of how memory affects managers’ corporate decision-making.</p>
